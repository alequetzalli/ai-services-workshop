## Overview

The AI Powered Speech Analytics for Amazon Connect solution provides customer insights in real-time, and helps agents and supervisors better understand and respond to customer needs so they can resolve customer issues and improve the overall customer experience. The solution uses pre-trained AWS Artificial Intelligence (AI) services that enable customers to transcribe, translate, and analyze each customer interaction, and presents this information to assist contact center agents during their conversations.

The solution combines:

* Amazon Transcribe to perform real-time speech recognition and create a high-quality text transcription of each call into text
* Amazon Comprehend to analyze the interaction, detect the sentiment of the caller, and identify key words and phrases in the conversation
* Amazon Translate to translate the conversation into an agentâ€™s preferred language.

You can use the transcribed information with your knowledge management and customer relationship management (CRM) systems to suggest responses or recommended solutions to better respond to the caller's needs.

Additionally, the solution stores the original audio files and conversation transcripts for later review or analysis
