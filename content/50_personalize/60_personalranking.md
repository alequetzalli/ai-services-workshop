## Create Personal Ranking Solution

1. Let's do exactly the same thing again, but this time we'll create a ranking solition.  From the **Solutions and Recipes** screen that you are on, click **Create solution**, give it a name like *rankings-solution*, ensure it's a **Manual** recipe selection but this time select the **aws-personalized-ranking** recipe.  Click **Next** and **Finished** as before

2. You now have three solutions being built off of the same dataset, and all three will slot into the application later.  Please now go back to the notebook and continue to build your recommendation campaign and do some quick testing - if the notebook solution still hasn't completed then you may continue with the first part of the next section, **Finalise Django Framework Configuration**
