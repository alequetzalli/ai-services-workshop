3. Click **Stop** to stop the Notebook Instance.  This does not delete the underlying data and resources.  After a few minutes the instance status will change to _Stopped_, and you can now click on the **Actions** dropdown again, but this time select **Delete**.

Note that by selecting the name of the Notebook instance on this dialog you are taken to a more detailed information page regarding that instance, which also has **Stop** and **Delete** buttons present â€“ notebooks can also be deleted using this method.
